# The Virtual Brain Inference

This repository contains our published research paper **“Virtual Brain Inference: A Practical Blueprint for Connectome Graphs, 
Neural Mass Models, Multimodal Data Fusion, Network Simulation, and Bayesian Personalization.”**

The work presents a unified, end-to-end framework for modeling large-scale brain dynamics using structural connectomes, neural mass 
models, and Bayesian inference. We propose a five-stage pipeline that integrates brain network graphs, biologically grounded neural 
mass models (e.g., Jansen–Rit, Wong–Wang, Stuart–Landau, Epileptor-lite), multimodal data fusion, and large-scale time-series simulation 
to enable personalized brain modeling.

The paper bridges theoretical neuroscience and practical engineering by providing mathematically grounded models along with 
implementation-oriented design choices. The current repository hosts the research paper, while the system-level ML and TVB-based 
implementation is planned as an extension of this work.
